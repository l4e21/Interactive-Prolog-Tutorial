# Power of Prolog Notes

This project is meant to serve as an interactive version of https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/introduction. It will teach you how to edit and work with Swi-Prolog projects naturally and the fundamentals of Prolog.

## Getting started

When you are ready, install swi-prolog https://www.swi-prolog.org/. Then, in your shell/terminal, type `swipl`. You are now in a session! 

Next, type `edit(src/introduction).` This will open swi-prolog's built-in `Pce-emacs` editor (https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=pceemacs). You can also reach this directly by running `emacs.` but `src/introduction.pl` which is opened by the former command is where our tutorial continues. See you there!
